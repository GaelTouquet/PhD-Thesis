chapeau : annonce du plan et motivation des sous-sections: recurent -> recursive.
tau against jets mainly ; throwback to jet clustering and tau reconstruction; main idea : use clustering with deep learning; also main idea : minimize information loss => particle level information; Study done on CMS simulated jets

\section{Simulated jet and tau datasets}

\subsection{Datasets}

\subsection{Signal and background definition}

seeding jet...

\section{The standard CMS $\tau_{h}$ID}

\subsection{Paricle flow $\tau_{h}$ algorithm}

\subsection{Multi-variate analysis for isolation}

\subsection{Performance}

c.f. PF flow paper

\subsection{Intrinsic limits}

information loss in process => deep learning should be better

\section{From a single neuron to recurrent networks}

\subsection{Basics : neurons, dense networks, deep learning}

\subsection{Recurrent neural networks}

class of neural networks that allows a flexible number of entry variables

A basic recurrent network

\subsection{Recursive neural network}

(include here a mix of gilles' work and mine to make a coherent and comprehensible case of the RecNN while aknowledging gilles' work here and there)

chapeau : gilles's work idea, our appropriation of the concept, optimisation and why it is adequate for TauId
