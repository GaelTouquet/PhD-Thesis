This thesis has presented an analysis of proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector during the 2017 data-taking period. The state of search for a MSSM heavy neutral Higgs boson decaying to tau pairs has been presented. This channel provides a direct probe of the Yukawa couplings between fermions and the Higgs field that give rise to the fermion masses. Expected results will be determined soon after the writing of this manuscript from distributions of the $m_{T}^{\mathrm{tot}}$ variable in the $\tauh\tauh$ final state. Categorisation is used to improve sensitivity to signal and to specific Higgs boson production modes. Expected upper limits at the $95\%$ CL will be determined in the $\ma-\mathrm{tan}\,\beta$ parameter space for the $m_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{max}}$ scenario. Additionally, model-independent expected limits on the cross section times branching fractions for a single Higgs boson produced via either gluon-gluon fusion or in association with b-quarks are determined for mass hypotheses in the range $90$ to $3200\,\mathrm{GeV}$.

A new hadronic tau decay identification technique, based on a neural network architecture called recursive neural network has also been presented. Its performance have been compared to the standard identification technique used in the CMS collaboration. This comparison highlighted a better QCD jet rejection in the high \tauh efficiency region. Some potential improvements to this approach have also been presented.

The LHC has opened a new high-energy frontier in the search for new physics beyond the SM. In 2021, the LHC will re-commence operation to gather even more data, allowing precision measurements as well as search for new physics on a new level. New data will offer an even better sensitivity to signatures of new physics.


The ambitious LHC physics program will continue for decades. After the end of Run 3,
planned for 2021â€“2023, the amount of collected data is expected to exceed 300
fb
