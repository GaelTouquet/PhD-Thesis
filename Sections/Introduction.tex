\textcolor{red}{(The Introduction chapter should contain background information as appropriate, plus definitions of all special and general terms. Your topic should be: clearly stated and defined; have a clear overall purpose; and have clear, relevant and coherent aims and objectives. It is also informative to give a brief description of the contents of the remaining chapters of the thesis. This alerts the reader and prepares them for the rest of the thesis.)}

\colin{Physics motivation and MSSM should not be part of Introduction. Call this chapter: Physics motivation. Then you need to talk about the standard model, the higgs, the mssm, etc. }
