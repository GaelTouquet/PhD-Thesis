@article{cms-detector,
	Abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.},

	abstract = {The CMS apparatus was identified, a few years before the   start of the LHC operation at CERN, to feature properties well   suited to particle-flow (PF) reconstruction: a highly-segmented   tracker, a fine-grained electromagnetic calorimeter, a hermetic   hadron calorimeter, a strong magnetic field, and an excellent muon   spectrometer.  A fully-fledged PF reconstruction algorithm tuned to   the CMS detector was therefore developed and has been consistently   used in physics analyses for the first time at a hadron   collider. For each collision, the comprehensive list of final-state   particles identified and reconstructed by the algorithm provides a   global event description that leads to unprecedented CMS performance   for jet and hadronic τ decay reconstruction, missing transverse   momentum determination, and electron and muon identification. This   approach also allows particles from pileup interactions to be   identified and enables efficient pileup mitigation methods. The data   collected by CMS at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV show excellent   agreement with the simulation and confirm the superior PF   performance at least up to an average of 20 pileup interactions.}

The method is formulated as an iterative re-weighted Kalman filter. Annealing is introduced to avoid local minima in the optimization. For the initialization of the adaptive filter a robust algorithm is presented that turns out to perform well in a wide range of applications. The tuning of the annealing schedule and of the cut-off parameter is described using simulated data from the CMS experiment. Finally, the adaptive property of the method is illustrated in two examples.}

abstract = "We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron–positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward–backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, mZ and ΓZ, and its couplings to fermions, for example the ρ parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured:mZ=91.1875±0.0021GeV,ΓZ=2.4952±0.0023GeV,ρℓ=1.0050±0.0010,sin2θefflept=0.23153±0.00016.The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840±0.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions. The results are compared to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). At the Z-pole, electroweak radiative corrections beyond the running of the QED and QCD coupling constants are observed with a significance of five standard deviations, and in agreement with the Standard Model. Of the many Z-pole measurements, the forward–backward asymmetry in b-quark production shows the largest difference with respect to its SM expectation, at the level of 2.8 standard deviations. Through radiative corrections evaluated in the framework of the Standard Model, the Z-pole data are also used to predict the mass of the top quark, mt=173-10+13GeV, and the mass of the W boson, mW=80.363±0.032GeV. These indirect constraints are compared to the direct measurements, providing a stringent test of the SM. Using in addition the direct measurements of mt and mW, the mass of the as yet unobserved SM Higgs boson is predicted with a relative uncertainty of about 50% and found to be less than 285GeV at 95% confidence level."

abstract = "Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin."

The incident electron's energy was reconstructed by summing the energy measured in arrays of 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 channels. There was no significant amount of correlated noise observed within these arrays. For electrons incident at the centre of the studied 3 × 3 arrays of crystals, the mean stochastic term was measured to be 2.8% and the mean constant term to be 0.3%. The amount of the incident electrons' energy which is contained within the array depends on its position of incidence. The variation of the containment with position is corrected for using the distribution of the measured energy within the array. For uniform illumination of a crystal with 120 GeV electrons a resolution of 0.5% was achieved. The energy resolution meets the design goal for the detector.}

The measured distributions of the major operational parameters of the drift tube (DT), cathode strip chamber (CSC), and resistive plate chamber (RPC) systems met the design specifications. The spatial resolution per chamber was 80–120 μm in the DTs, 40–150 μm in the CSCs, and 0.8–1.2 cm in the RPCs. The time resolution achievable was 3 ns or better per chamber for all 3 systems. The efficiency for reconstructing hits and track segments originating from muons traversing the muon chambers was in the range 95–98$\%$. The CSC and DT systems provided muon track segments for the CMS trigger with over 96$\%$ efficiency, and identified the correct triggering bunch crossing in over 99.5$\%$ of such events. The measured performance is well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulation of the muon system down to the level of individual channel response. The results confirm the high efficiency of the muon system, the robustness of the design against hardware failures, and its effectiveness in the discrimination of backgrounds.}

The paper focuses on prompt isolated electrons with transverse momenta ranging from about 5 to a few 100 GeV. A detailed description is given of the algorithms used to cluster energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and to reconstruct electron trajectories in the tracker. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the calorimeter with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Benchmark selection criteria are presented, and their performances assessed using Z, Υ, and J/ψ decays into e+ + e− pairs. The spectra of the observables relevant to electron reconstruction and selection as well as their global efficiencies are well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The momentum scale is calibrated with an uncertainty smaller than 0.3%. The momentum resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays ranges from 1.7 to 4.5%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through bremsstrahlung in the detector material.}

	abstract = {The bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution of electrons propagating in matter is highly non-Gaussian. Because the Kalman filter relies solely on Gaussian probability density functions, it is not necessarily the optimal reconstruction algorithm for electron tracks. A Gaussian-sum filter (GSF) algorithm for electron reconstruction in the CMS tracker has therefore been developed and implemented. The basic idea is to model the bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution by a Gaussian mixture rather than by a single Gaussian. It is shown that the GSF is able to improve the momentum resolution of electrons compared to the standard Kalman filter. The momentum resolution and the quality of the error estimate are studied both with a fast simulation, modelling the radiative energy loss in a simplified detector, and the full CMS tracker simulation.}

maintenance of the calibration in the challenging radiation
environment inside the CMS detector. The energy resolution for
electrons from Z-boson decays is better than 2% in the central

2–5% elsewhere. The derived energy resolution for photons from

2.6% and from 2.2% to 5% in the endcaps. The calibration of the

has been studied using 40 pb−1 of data collected in pp collisions

A few benchmark sets of selection criteria
covering a wide range of physics analysis needs have been examined.
For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify
a muon with a transverse momentum pT larger than a few GeV/c is above 95%
over the whole region of pseudorapidity covered by the CMS muon system,
|η| < 2.4,
while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is well below 1%.
The efficiency to trigger on single muons
with pT above a few GeVc is higher than 90% over the full η range, and typically substantially better.
The overall momentum scale is measured to a precision of 0.2% with muons from Z decays.
The transverse momentum resolution varies from 1% to 6% depending on
pseudorapidity for muons with pT below 100GeV/c and, using
cosmic rays, it is shown to be better than 10% in the
central region up to pT = 1 TeV/c.
Observed distributions of all quantities are
well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation.}

MadGraph 5 builds on the same philosophy as the previous versions, and its design allows it to be used as a collaborative platform where theoretical, phenomenological and simulation projects can be developed and then distributed to the high-energy community. We describe the ideas and the most important developments of the code and illustrate its capabilities through a few simple phenomenological examples.",

  (NLO) calculation of a given QCD process with a parton shower Monte
  Carlo (MC) simulation. The method has the following features: fully
  exclusive events are generated, with hadronization according to the
  MC model; total exclusive rates are accurate to NLO; NLO results for
  distributions are recovered upon expansion in αs; hard emissions
  are treated as in NLO computations while soft/collinear emissions
  are handled by the MC simulation, with the same logarithmic accuracy
  as the MC; and matching between the hard- and
  soft/collinear-emission regions is smooth. A fraction of events with
  negative weight is generated, but unweighting remains possible with
  reasonable efficiency.  The method is clarified using a simple toy
  model, and illustrated by application to the hadroproduction of
  W+W− pairs.}

abstract="A Higgs-like particle with a mass of about 125.5 GeV has been discovered at the LHC. Within the current experimental uncertainties, this new state is compatible with both the predictions for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and with the Higgs sector in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We propose new low-energy MSSM benchmark scenarios that, over a wide parameter range, are compatible with the mass and production rates of the observed signal. These scenarios also exhibit interesting phenomenology for the MSSM Higgs sector. We propose a slightly updated version of the well-known {\$}m{\_}{\{}h{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max{\}}{\$}scenario, and a modified scenario ({\$}m{\_}{\{}h{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}mod{\}}{\}}{\$}), where the light {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$}-even Higgs boson can be interpreted as the LHC signal in large parts of the MA--tan$\beta$ plane. Furthermore, we define a light stop scenario that leads to a suppression of the lightest {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$}-even Higgs gluon fusion rate, and a light stau scenario with an enhanced decay rate of h{\textrightarrow}$\gamma$$\gamma$ at large tan$\beta$. We also suggest a $\tau$-phobic Higgs scenario in which the lightest Higgs can have suppressed couplings to down-type fermions. We propose to supplement the specified value of the $\mu$ parameter in some of these scenarios with additional values of both signs. This has a significant impact on the interpretation of searches for the non-SM-like MSSM Higgs bosons. We also discuss the sensitivity of the searches to heavy Higgs decays into light charginos and neutralinos, and to decays of the form H{\textrightarrow}hh. Finally, in addition to all the other scenarios where the lightest {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$}-even Higgs is interpreted as the LHC signal, we propose a low-MHscenario, where instead the heavy{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$}-even Higgs boson corresponds to the new state around 125.5 GeV.",

The changes include a revised reconstruction of π0 candidates, and improvements in multivariate discriminants to separate τ leptons from jets and electrons. The algorithm is extended to reconstruct τ leptons in highly Lorentz-boosted pair production, and in the high-level trigger. The performance of the algorithm is studied using  proton-proton collisions recorded during 2016 at √s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The performance is evaluated in terms of the efficiency for a genuine τ lepton to pass the identification criteria and of the probabilities for jets, electrons, and muons to be misidentified as τ leptons. The results are found to be very close to those expected from Monte Carlo simulation.}

abstract = "A library of Monte Carlo programs for leptonic and semileptonic decays of the τ lepton is presented. It provides final state with full topology including neutrinos, resonant distributions for intermediate particles and complete spin structure throughout the decay. The program is constructed in such a way that it can be easily attached to any Monte Carlo program simulating the production of τ's. It contains subprograms simulating the following decay channels: τ± → vve±, vvμ±, vμ±, vϱ±, va±1, vK±, vK∗±, vnπ±,0, n > 3. The decay products are coded in the Lund format."

The transverse momentum balance in dijet and γ/Z+jets events is used to measure the jet energy response in the CMS detector, as well as the transverse momentum resolution. The results are presented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-based approach, the ``Jet-Plus-Track'' approach, which improves the measurement of calorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks, and the ``Particle Flow'' approach, which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in the event, prior to the jet clustering, based on information from all relevant subdetectors.}

The distributions may be in the form of continuous functions or histograms. The prescription is based on the weighted mean of the inverses of the cumulative distributions between which the interpolation is made. The result is particularly elegant for a certain class of distributions, including the normal and exponential distributions, and is useful for the interpolation of Monte Carlo simulation results which are time-consuming to obtain."

Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.",

    abstract = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }
